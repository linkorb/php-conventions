## Security

At LinkORB we often develop applications that are designed to handle confidential data.

Therefor we expect developers to familiarize themselves with the [Security by design](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Security_by_Design_Principles) principles as described by OWASP.

Code reviews will be performed on any code that gets checked in, paying special attention to these points.

### Holistic security

Writing secure PHP code is only part of the puzzle. Topic-specific security principles will be applied in all relevant components of a production system. For example:

* Infrastructure security
* Architecture
* Confidential information (Credentials, secrets, etc) handling
* SQL security
* Project management
* Access management
* Team-member background checks

## Templates

* Use Twig for templating
* Use Bootstrap 3 for all basic CSS
* Use font-awesome for icons
* Templates are stored in `templates/` in the root of your project
* Use a shared layout.html.twig file that other twig templates extend.
* Always use named routes for links (using `path`) instead of hard-coded links. Your app will be on different base URLs in production.
